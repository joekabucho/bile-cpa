                <p class="text-black-05">Many times we find that financial facts cannot speak for themselves. They are complex and need to be interpreted in a way that makes them clear to attorneys. We believes that one of our most important roles is to work with businesses on
                    forensic accounting matters or attorneys on litigation matters to help them understand the financial facts related to their case. With this understanding, as well as being able to partner with a financial expert who can clearly present
                    and translate these facts at trial, the attorney or business owner is better prepared to build his or her case.</p>
