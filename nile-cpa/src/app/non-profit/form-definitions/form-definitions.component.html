                <p class="text-black-05"> <span class="text-black-08 font-weight-bold">Private Benefit</span></p>
                <p class="text-black-05"> A 501(c)(3) exempt organization must be organized and operated so that no part of its net earnings inures to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual. Thus, the “private benefit” doctrine prohibits causing the income or assets
                    of a tax-exempt organization from flowing away from the organization and to one or more persons.</p>
                <p class="text-black-05"> When an organization’s insiders receive inappropriate private benefit, it is called “inurnment.” Any amount of inurnment, no matter how small, is grounds for revocation of exempt status. Private benefit to non-insiders is also prohibited,
                    but the IRS must show that the prohibited benefit to non-insiders is substantial in order to sustain revocation.</p>

                <p class="text-black-05"> <span class="text-black-08 font-weight-bold">Private Foundation</span></p>
                <p class="text-black-05"> Organizations exempt under 501(c)(3) are private foundations unless they are churches, schools, hospitals, governmental units, entities that undertake testing for public safety, organizations that have broad financial support from the
                    general public, or organizations that support one or more other organizations that are themselves classified as public charities.</p>
                <p class="text-black-05"> Generally, a private foundation is a charitable organization funded by one or a small number of sources. Its ongoing funding generally comes from investment income, which it uses to make grants for charitable purposes to other persons
                    or organizations.</p>

                <p class="text-black-05"> <span class="text-black-08 font-weight-bold">Public Charity</span></p>
                <p class="text-black-05"> Organizations that are exempt under section 501(c)(3) and are not private foundations. Public charity status is generally considered a more favorable tax status than private foundation status.</p>

                <p class="text-black-05"> Games in which an individual places a wager by purchasing preprinted cards that are covered with pull-tabs. Winners are revealed when the individual pulls back the sealed tabs on the front of the card and compares the patterns under the
                    tabs with the winning patterns preprinted on the back of the card. Instant bingo, mini bingo, and similar scratch-off cards are all types of pull-tabs. None of these games qualifies for the “bingo exception” to UBI because none meets
                    the definition of traditional bingo.</p>
