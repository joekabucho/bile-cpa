                <p class="text-black-05">NileCPA has done and continues to do work for many non-profit organizations, primarily doing audits and compilations. The types of non-profits served are health and welfare organizations, those that are subject to governmental auditing
                    standards, and those, for example charter schools, that have to comply with Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) 34 because they are a component unit of a school district.</p>

                <p class="text-black-05">Non-Profit organizations that receive federal grants of more than $500,000 in any fiscal year are subject to the single audit requirements. Also commonly known as the Single Audit, or the OMB A-133 audit which is a rigorous, organization-wide
                    audit or examination of an entity that expends $500,000 or more of Federal assistance (commonly known as Federal funds, Federal grants, or Federal awards) received for its operations</p>
                <p class="text-black-05">Non-Profits are required to file tax return form 990, which is due 4 and a half months after fiscal year end. For example, an organization that has a December 31st fiscal year end would be required to file by May 15th of the following
                    year.
